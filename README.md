## Usage

### Dashboard Features

**Live Match Analysis**
- Enter match details including home/away teams and relevant features
- Input bookmaker odds to get AI-powered predictions
- View model probability vs implied odds probability
- Get recommended bet actions with confidence levels

**Betting Recommendations**
- **BET**: Model identifies positive expected value above threshold
- **NO BET**: Insufficient edge detected
- Recommended stake size calculated using Kelly Criterion
- Confidence score based on expected value magnitude

**Paper Trading Simulation**
- Simulate bet outcomes to track performance
- No real money involved - educational purposes only
- Track bankroll changes over time

**Performance Dashboard**
- Real-time bankroll curve visualization
- Win/loss statistics and distribution
- ROI and profit tracking
- Detailed bet history with all transactions

### Configuration Options

Access the sidebar to adjust:
- Initial bankroll amount
- Kelly fraction (risk management)
- Expected value threshold for bet recommendations

**NOTE:** This is a paper trading simulation for educational purposes. No real bets are placed.
